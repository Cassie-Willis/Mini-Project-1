// ------------BSP_Joystick_Init------------
// Initialize a GPIO pin for input, which corresponds
// with BoosterPack pin J1.5 (Select button).
// Initialize two ADC pins, which correspond with
// BoosterPack pins J1.2 (X) and J3.26 (Y).
// Input: none
// Output: none
void BSP_Joystick_Init(void);

// ------------BSP_Joystick_Input------------
// Read and return the immediate status of the
// joystick.  Button de-bouncing for the Select
// button is not considered.  The joystick X- and
// Y-positions are returned as 10-bit numbers,
// even if the ADC on the LaunchPad is more precise.
// Input: x is pointer to store X-position (0 to 1023)
//        y is pointer to store Y-position (0 to 1023)
//        select is pointer to store Select status (0 if pressed)
// Output: none
// Assumes: BSP_Joystick_Init() has been called
